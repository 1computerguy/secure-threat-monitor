1) Ingest data from DB's or log files (still TBD)
2) FOR INITIAL TRAINING (if required):
    a) Split into test/train dataset
    b) Normalize (see below)
    b) Perform initial training
3) Normalize data (MinMaxScaler has been proven effective here)
4) Send normalized data to learning algorithm (or first stage - still TBD)
    If multi-stage (like self-taught learning framework)
    a) Send to first state - autoencoder or other multidimensional in and multidimensional out
    b) Send output to stage 2
    c) Determine available outputs
    d) Forward (or make API for) available outputs
