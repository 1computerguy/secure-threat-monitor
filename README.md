# Secure Threat Monitor platform

This system was designed as a result of my Master's thesis and focuses on analyzing secure network traffic. This platform gathers secure network traffic and performs unencrypted analysis of the data providing visualization through Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.

## Tools used:
  - Cisco Mercury (https://github.com/cisco/mercury)
  - NetCap (https://github.com/dreadl0ck/netcap/tree/v0.5)
  - sFlow Collector
  - check_ip.py (Custom tool using urlhaus.abuse.ch and AlienVault OTX for malicious IP detection)
  - Prometheus (https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
  - Grafana (https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
